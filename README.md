# Graph-in-Graph (GiG)
Learning interpretable latent graphs in the non-Euclidean domain for molecule prediction and healthcare applications (Original code)


## Instructions

We provide two implementations of the suggested GraphInGraph model. In **gig_pl** is located the implementation used for the second table in * , except DGCNN experiments. In **gig_origin** can be found our first implementation used to run experiments for the first table. For understanding, the code and experiments we suggest using code from **gig_pl**, which is clearer and can be much easier to adapt to new datasets. In the future, the code in **folder gig_origin** will be aligned with code in **folder gig_pl**.

Precise instructions can be found in each folder in **README.md** files.
